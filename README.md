# Add Authentication and RBAC to an Angular App

This repository contains two applications - `starter-app` and `starter-app-with-auth`.

## `starter-app`
This application keeps an inventory of books and it provides the ability to view the books with their details and add new books using a form. Clicking each item expands it and displays more information about the book. This also provides an option to delete a book.

## `starter-app-with-auth`
This application builds on top of `starter-app`, and it has a layer of authentication. It integrates with the Descope API to create a seamless authentication and authorization flow using magic links and role-based access control (RBAC).
