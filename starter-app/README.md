# Add Authentication and RBAC to an Angular App - Starter App
This is a simple Angular application that serves as a book inventory management system. Here are its main functionalities:

**View Books:** Users can browse a list of books, with the ability to expand each entry to view detailed information.

**Add New Books:** There is a form that allows users to add new books to the inventory by filling out required fields, including title, author, genre, publication year, and ISBN.

**Delete Books:** Users can remove books from the inventory by expanding on a book and clicking on the Delete button.
